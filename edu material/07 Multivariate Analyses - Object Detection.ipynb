    "    \"#### Introduction to Object Detection\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which only assigns a label to an image, object detection provides both the class label and the bounding box coordinates of objects present in the image.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### YOLO (You Only Look Once)\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional object detection methods that use region proposals, YOLO treats object detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the image in one pass.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"#### How YOLO Works\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1. **Image Grid Division**: The input image is divided into an \\\\( S \\\\times S \\\\) grid.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2. **Bounding Box Prediction**: Each grid cell predicts a fixed number of bounding boxes along with confidence scores.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"3. **Class Probability Prediction**: Each bounding box is assigned a class label with a probability.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"4. **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: Overlapping boxes are filtered to retain the most confident detections.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"#### Advantages of YOLO\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Fast Inference**: YOLO can process images in real-time, making it suitable for applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **End-to-End Training**: Unlike region-based methods, YOLO is trained as a single neural network, making it more efficient.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **Global Context Awareness**: Since YOLO processes the entire image at once, it reduces false positives compared to sliding window or region-based methods.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"#### Variants of YOLO\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **YOLOv1-v3**: Initial versions that introduced the concept and improved accuracy.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **YOLOv4**: Optimized for better speed and precision.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **YOLOv5**: A widely used implementation with improvements in efficiency.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- **YOLOv7 & YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art versions focusing on faster inference and higher detection accuracy.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Due to its real-time performance and high accuracy, YOLO is widely used in applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical diagnostics.\"\n",

    "    \"# Fine-Tuning YOLO and Labeling Your Own Data  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"YOLO is already a strong object detection model, but in some cases, you may want to fine-tune it to improve performance for your specific use case. One way to do this is by using pre-trained YOLO models provided by platforms like **[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)**, which offer easy-to-use training pipelines. Alternatively, if your dataset is not labeled yet, you’ll need to label your own data before training. **[Explanation video about labeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3SBRtILjPI)**\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Labeling is the process of defining the target objects in your dataset by drawing bounding boxes around them and specifying their class. This is essential for training an object detection model. One of the most popular tools for labeling data is Roboflow, which allows you to upload images, annotate them, and export them in formats compatible with YOLO. To get started, sign up for a Roboflow account.  \\n\",\n",
